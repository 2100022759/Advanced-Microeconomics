# Advanced-Microeconomics
This is the second half of the first-year Ph.D. course in microeconomic theory. 
This half is an introduction to the principles of game theory at a graduate level, including both 
theory and applications.
The goal of the course is to provide the students with sufficient knowledge of game theory to 
be able to read applied research papers. Also we will discuss why economists have chosen these 
solution concepts and their limitations.

Main Texts. No textbook is required and the following books are recommended.
[G] Gibbons, R., Game Theory for Applied Economists.
[JR] Jehle, G. and P. Reny, Advanced Microeconomic Theory (2nd Edition).

Supplementary Readings.
[MWG] Mas-Collel, A., M. Whinston, and J. Green, Microeconomic Theory.
[FT] Fudenberg, D. and J. Tirole, Game Theory.
[DN] Dixit, A. and S. Nalebuff, Thinking Strategically.
MWG and FT are references for advanced topics. DN is a popular introduction to game theory. 
None of these books are required.
